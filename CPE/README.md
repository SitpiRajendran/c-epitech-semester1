# {EPITECH.} - CPE - ELEMENTARY PROGRAMMING IN C

## Description

In a variety of ways, this unit will train you in (and allow you to practice the basics of) programming and problem analysis and the division and rigorous implementation that they demand. 
This unit will prepare you for, and give you practice in, the basics of programming, troubleshooting, and their division and meticulous completion.  
This unit covers classic programming aspects such as simple data structures arrays, linked lists, stacks) in different scenarios (data sorting, identifying holes in grid maps)
This unit will address the programming aspects that are associated with the simple computer manipulation of a file descriptor, memory management, and static variables. 

## Skills

- Be capable of showing accuracy: reading a subject correctly, coding within the Norms in order to have a clear and logical division of projects, following the rendering’s instructions…
- Demonstrate the ability to correctly employ the language: syntax and simple data structures 
- Demonstrate the ability to solve simple problems by using simple algorithms
- Make at least one functional rendering
- be capable of attention to detail: correctly read a subject, respect the norm in order to achieve a clear and logical division of your project, respect the rendering instructions etc
- demonstrate the capacity to correctly manipulate C programming language: the syntax, the structures, and simple data.
- demonstrate the capacity to solve simple problems through simple algorithms.
- execute a functional delivery


## Projects

-----
### [BSQ - Biggest SQuare](https://github.com/SitpiRajendran/epitech-semester1/tree/master/CPE/CPE_BSQ_2018)
You must find the largest possible square on a board while avoiding obstacles.

-----
### [Get Next Line](https://github.com/SitpiRajendran/epitech-semester1/tree/master/CPE/CPE_getnextline_2018)
The goal of this project is to write a function that returns a read line from a file descriptor.

-----
### [MatchStick](https://github.com/SitpiRajendran/epitech-semester1/tree/master/CPE/CPE_matchstick_2018)
This project is based on a very famous game based on matchsticks. There is a certain number of matchstick lines. The two players take turns; each player can, on a same line, take one or several matchsticks. The losing player is the one to take the last matchstick.
The goal of the project is to create a program that you can play against.

-----
### [PushSwap](https://github.com/SitpiRajendran/epitech-semester1/tree/master/CPE/CPE_pushswap_2018)
The game is made up of two lists of numbers named l_a and l_b.
In the beginning, l_b will be empty and l_a will contain a certain amount of positive or negative numbers.
The objective of the game is to sort l_a
